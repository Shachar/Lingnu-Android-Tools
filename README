Available tools:
split_bootimg - a generic tool for splitting a boot image created using
    mkbootimg. The tool auto-detects the actual (as opposed to reported) page
    size, and dumps all relevant info about the boot image. The tool makes no
    assumptions about the parameters used in order to create the boot image.

new_strings - has 2 functions:
    + given 3 files : old_english_strings.xml newer_english_strings.xml localized_strings.xml
      will output new localized  strings.xml based on old, new, and localized versions of 
      of strings.xml (reflects changes between the old and new version :  dropped, new
      and modified string entries)
      
    + given 2 files : old_localized_strings.xml newer_localized_strings.xml
      will output merged version of the 2 files, prefering newer string entries
      if exists.

zzos - the reverse of aapt. Decompile the resources of an apk to a format
    suitable for recompilation using aapt. "zzos" is "aapt" shifted one
    letter down.
