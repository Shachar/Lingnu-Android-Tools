split_bootimg - a generic tool for splitting a boot image created using
    mkbootimg. The tool auto-detects the actual (as opposed to reported) page
    size, and dumps all relevant info about the boot image. The tool makes no
    assumptions about the parameters used in order to create the boot image.
